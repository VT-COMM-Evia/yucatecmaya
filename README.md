# Documenting and Preserving Yucatec Maya 

This repository houses the pilot project for a social justice-based approach to documenting and preserving Yucatec Maya.

Spoken by some 800,000 people in Mexico and some areas of Central America, Yucatec Maya has been documented in quite uneven ways, which include the work of non-native speaking linguists and, more recently, the work of native scholars and activists. We have identified discrepancies in those approaches (non-native linguists use international phonetic representations while native scholars have proposed a standardized alphabet that is not well known outside of Mexico).

We aim to start combining those approaches on a multimedia website with customizable interfaces in three languages (English, Spanish, and Yucatec Maya) to address the needs of academic and community audiences interested in the language.

Language revitalization efforts like this one are firmly rooted in social justice because they aim to promote equity in opportunities for speakers to maintain and use a language that has experienced persecution for centuries.

Our initial goal is to build a pilot of the website focusing on introductory vocabulary and  grammar concepts.
